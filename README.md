# SimpleTaskManager
This is a very lightweight project that I just started because I wanted a more visually-appealing and minimalistic personal organization app. Core capabilities will include task management, access control and authorization, persistence of tasks, and archival/retrieval, among others. The application features a RESTful API that can currently facilitate basic task adding/updating/retrieval/deletion.

Technology stack:
- MongoDB
- Express
- AngularJS
- NodeJS
- Bootstrap
- FontAwesome

Connection string must be edited and provided by the user in the config.js file to have tasks saved and for the application to perform CRUD operations.

Future developments: to-do list styling enhancements, authorization/user accounts, modal for completed tasks where the user can "restore" accidentally deleted tasks, account settings editing, multiple lists (i.e. personal, grocery, etc.), responsiveness testing, deployability testing (Amazon Web Services, Heroku, Azure, GCP).
