# SimpleTaskManager
This is a project that I just started arising from a need for a more visually-appealing and minimalistic personal organization app. Core capabilities will include task management, access control and authorization, persistence of tasks, and archival/retrieval, among others. The application features a RESTful API that can currently facilitate basic task adding/updating/retrieval/deletion.

Technology stack:
- MongoDB
- Express
- AngularJS
- NodeJS
- Bootstrap
- FontAwesome

Connection string must be edited and provided by the user in config.js in order to have tasks saved and for the application to perform CRUD operations.
